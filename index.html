    <h1>This is My Test Webpage!</h1>

    <p>I'm a novice at web design, but I am going to improve to the point that I can make a career out of this!
      Here are my current goals!
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Improve My JavaScript!</li>
      <li>Improve My DOM Manipulation!</li>
      <li>Learn to Style Better!</li>
      <li>Improve My Understanding of API's!</li>
      <li>Get Comfortable Making Objects Using JSON!</li>
      <li>Improve My AJAX Skills!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I'm currently working through a Software Engineering Bootcamp's online coursework, but I also want to work on the MDN
      tutorials because I definitely believe it's worth working on! I don't just want to accumulate knowledge through one source.
      This is the internet, after all: A giant repository of information on all subjects! If I can't learn something from the benevolent,
      open-source curators of the modern web, then I might as well look into another career!
    </p>

    <p>
      If you'd like to make a simple web page, like this one, then check out their
      "<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web" target="_blank">Getting Started With The Web</a>"
      course to get started! Then work through the rest of their awesome tutorials; that's what I plan on doing!
